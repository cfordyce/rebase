C Programming Advanced
Exercise 9

Very sorry about the funky formatting.  
I'm using xemacs and it just treats text as one long line unless I add carriage returns.


The Long Jump / Signal Handling program plays out like this.  
First, signal() is called which registers a new signal handler that acts on the SIGABRT signal.  ]
This initial call returns SIG_DFL to the variable 'rcode'.  
Then we test the value stored in 'rcode' and establish if the call to signal() was successful or not.  
The we call setjmp() which saves the current stack context/environment for later use by longjmp().  

We then test the return value of setjmp(), which is stored in the variable 'error'.  
If 'error' is empty, we send the SIGABRT signal to the program via raise().  
Then raise() calls sig_handler().  
This time the signal sent to sig_handler() is the real SIGABRT.  
signal() is called again, but with a real signal (SIGABRT).  
Next, longjump() is called with the program context.  
The program then resumes where setjmp() was originally called.  






Thanks,  I enjoyed your class!
