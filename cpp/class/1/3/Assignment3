Assignment 3

3-1 An array is a common structure for storing information. In many programming languages, one must specify the size of the array in advance of its use. Frequently, however, one does not know how much data will need to be stored. A common solution is to declare the array to be much larger than is expected will be necessary in hopes that it will be large enough. This is certainly not the most efficient solution.


Design and implement an array of integers that expands as data is added, and contracts as data is removed. 

--It should be possible to add an element onto the end of the array. The array expands to accommodate the insertion. 

--It should be possible to insert an element into the array at any position within the bounds of the array. The array expands to accommodate the insertion. 

--It should be possible to remove an element at any position. The array contracts to accommodate the deletion. 

--It should be possible to get the integer value of an element in the array (although it is an error to attempt to get an element outside the bounds of the array). 

--It should be possible to display the contents of the array.





3-2 As the president of Big Bucks Consulting, as well as its chief designer, you have been hired by Fleecem National Bank to upgrade its customer database. You have chosen to rewrite the database using C++.

Each customer account consists of a savings portion and a checking portion.

a) Specify and describe, textually, in several paragraphs, the primary public and private components of a customer account. Don?t get carried away here - there are only a few basic attributes of such an account.

b) Design and declare (in a header file) a C++ class that fulfills the requirements of part (a). Be sure to include all the data and function members. Do not implement any methods; do not create the source file.
