3-2 As the president of Big Bucks Consulting, as well as its chief designer, you have been hired by Fleecem National Bank to upgrade its customer database. You have chosen to rewrite the database using C++.

Each customer account consists of a savings portion and a checking portion.

a) Specify and describe, textually, in several paragraphs, the primary public and private components of a customer account. Don?t get carried away here - there are only a few basic attributes of such an account.

b) Design and declare (in a header file) a C++ class that fulfills the requirements of part (a). Be sure to include all the data and function members. Do not implement any methods; do not create the source file.

// My stuff
For the new class "FleecemCustomerAccount" (FCA) to properly encapsulate the desired features of the new DB, we have laid out the following description of attributes:

PUBLIC MEMBERS
       + Constructor
	 - takes 3 args: Customer First,Last and Middle names, respectively.
       + Destructor
         - takes no args, destroys the object.

       + Public Methods
	 There are "getter" functions for all attributes in private scope.  The getters simply return
	 the current value held by the variable they address. The getters are intended to be used 
	 by other classes that need access to customer account data.
	 Attributes in public scope are those that shall be useful to any other component of our
	 system; all public methods return const objects:
		    - getFirstName()
		    - getLastName()
		    - getMiddleName()
		    - getCustomerId()
		    - getCheckingId()
		    - getSavingsId()
		    - getCheckingBalance()
		    - getSavingsBalance()

       + Private Methods
         Conversly, each public getter method has a matching private "setter" method. The setters are
	 necessarily private as the variables they manipulate is very sensitive.  Futhermore, most
	 customer account data will remain static, thus negating the need for accessor methods. Like
	 their counterpart public methods, the setters will return const objects:
		    - setFirstName()
		    - setLastName()
		    - setMiddleName()
		    - setCustomerId()
		    - setCheckingId()
		    - setSavingsId()
		    - setCheckingBalance()
		    - setSavingsBalance()
	
	+ Private Class Variables
	  The class provides the following variables for use in the class; getters and 
	  setters are provided for public and private access:
		  + Customer Name
		  	  - string first_name
			  - string last name
			  - string middle_name

	          + Account Numbers
		            - long int customer_id
			    - long int checking_id
			    - long int savings_id
			    
                  + Account Balances
			    - double checking_balance
			    - double savings_balance


And now the representation as a C++ class:

class FleecemCustomerAccount {

public:
	FleecemCustomerAccount(string, string, string);
	~FleecemCustomerAccount();

	const string getFirstName();
	const string getLastName();
	const string getMiddleName();
	const long int getCustomerId();
	const long int getCheckingId();
	const long int getSavingsId();
	const double getCheckingBalance();
	const double getSavingsBalance();

private:
	string first_name,last_name,middle_name;
	long int customer_id,checking_id,savings_id;
	double checking_balance,savings_balance;

	const string setFirstName(string);
	const string setLastName(string);
	const string setMiddleName(string);
	const long int setCustomerId(long int);
	const long int setCheckingId(long int);
	const long int setSavingsId(long int);
	const double setCheckingBalance(double);
	const double setSavingsBalance(double);
}
