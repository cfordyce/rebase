Assignment 4

4-1 Define a probe that can be inserted into a class or function as a test coverage device. For a class, the probe is to keep track of the number of instances of the class that exist and the number that have been created since the program was started. For a function, the probe is to track how many times the function is called.

In either case, the probe is to respond with the appropriate tracking information when the class instance or function containing the probe is queried. It will be necessary to figure out the best way to present the query. Demonstrate your probe on a class with multiple instances and on several functions.
