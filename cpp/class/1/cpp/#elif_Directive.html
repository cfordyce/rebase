<h4>The `<samp>#elif</samp>' Directive</h4>
<p>
One common case of nested conditionals is used to check for more than two possible alternatives. For example, you might have <p>
<pre>
	#if X == 1
	...
	#else /* X != 1 */
	#if X == 2
	...
	#else /* X != 2 */
	...
	#endif /* X != 2 */
	#endif /* X != 1 */
</pre>
<p>
Another conditional directive, `<samp>#elif</samp>', allows this to be abbreviated as follows: <p>
<pre>
	#if X == 1
	...
	#elif X == 2
	...
	#else /* X != 2 and X != 1*/
	...
	#endif /* X != 2 and X != 1*/
</pre>
<p>
`<samp>#elif</samp>' stands for ``else if''. Like `<samp>#else</samp>', it goes in the middle of a `<samp>#if</samp>'-`<samp>#endif</samp>' pair and subdivides it; it does not require a matching `<samp>#endif</samp>' of its own. Like `<samp>#if</samp>', the `<samp>#elif</samp>' directive includes an expression to be tested. <p>
The text following the `<samp>#elif</samp>' is processed only if the original `<samp>#if</samp>'-condition failed and the `<samp>#elif</samp>' condition succeeds. More than one `<samp>#elif</samp>' can go in the same `<samp>#if</samp>'-`<samp>#endif</samp>' group. Then the text after each `<samp>#elif</samp>' is processed only if the `<samp>#elif</samp>' condition succeeds after the original `<samp>#if</samp>' and any previous `<samp>#elif</samp>' directives within it have failed. `<samp>#else</samp>' is equivalent to `<samp>#elif 1</samp>', and `<samp>#else</samp>' is allowed after any number of `<samp>#elif</samp>' directives, but `<samp>#elif</samp>' may not follow `<samp>#else</samp>'. <p>
