<h4>Cascaded Use of Macros</h4>
<p>
A <i>cascade</i> of macros is when one macro's body contains a reference to another macro. This is very common practice. For example, <p>
<pre>
	#define BUFSIZE 1020
	#define TABLESIZE BUFSIZE
</pre>
<p>
This is not at all the same as defining `<samp>TABLESIZE</samp>' to be `<samp>1020</samp>'. The `<samp>#define</samp>' for `<samp>TABLESIZE</samp>' uses exactly the body you specify---in this case, `<samp>BUFSIZE</samp>'---and does not check to see whether it too is the name of a macro. <p>
It's only when you <em>use</em> `<samp>TABLESIZE</samp>' that the result of its expansion is checked for more macro names. <p>
This makes a difference if you change the definition of `<samp>BUFSIZE</samp>' at some point in the source file. `<samp>TABLESIZE</samp>', defined as shown, will always expand using the definition of `<samp>BUFSIZE</samp>' that is currently in effect: <p>
<pre>
	#define BUFSIZE 1020
	#define TABLESIZE BUFSIZE
	#undef BUFSIZE
	#define BUFSIZE 37
</pre>
<p>
Now `<samp>TABLESIZE</samp>' expands (in two stages) to `<samp>37</samp>'. (The `<samp>#undef</samp>' is to prevent any warning about the nontrivial redefinition of <code>BUFSIZE</code> .) <p>
