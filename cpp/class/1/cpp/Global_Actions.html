<h3>Transformations Made Globally</h3>
<p>
Most C preprocessor features are inactive unless you give specific directives to request their use. (Preprocessing directives are lines starting with `<samp>#</samp>'; see <a href="Directives.html">Directives</a>). But there are three transformations that the preprocessor always makes on all the input it receives, even in the absence of directives. <p>
<ul>
<li><p>
All C comments are replaced with single spaces. <p>
<li><p>
Backslash-Newline sequences are deleted, no matter where. This feature allows you to break long lines for cosmetic purposes without changing their meaning. <p>
<li><p>
Predefined macro names are replaced with their expansions (see <a href="Predefined.html">Predefined</a>). </ul>
<p>
The first two transformations are done <em>before</em> nearly all other parsing and before preprocessing directives are recognized. Thus, for example, you can split a line cosmetically with Backslash-Newline anywhere (except when trigraphs are in use; see below). <p>
<pre>
	/*
	*/ # /*
	*/ defi\
	ne FO\
	O 10\
	20
</pre>
<p>
is equivalent into `<samp>#define FOO 1020</samp>'. You can split even an escape sequence with Backslash-Newline. For example, you can split <code>"foo\bar"</code>  between the `<samp>\</samp>' and the `<samp>b</samp>' to get <p>
<pre>
	"foo\\
	bar"
</pre>
<p>
This behavior is unclean: in all other contexts, a Backslash can be inserted in a string constant as an ordinary character by writing a double Backslash, and this creates an exception. But the ANSI C standard requires it. (Strict ANSI C does not allow Newlines in string constants, so they do not consider this a problem.) <p>
But there are a few exceptions to all three transformations. <p>
<ul>
<li><p>
C comments and predefined macro names are not recognized inside a `<samp>#include</samp>' directive in which the file name is delimited with `<samp>&lt;</samp>' and `<samp>&gt;</samp>'. <p>
<li><p>
C comments and predefined macro names are never recognized within a character or string constant. (Strictly speaking, this is the rule, not an exception, but it is worth noting here anyway.) <p>
<li><p>
Backslash-Newline may not safely be used within an ANSI ``trigraph''. Trigraphs are converted before Backslash-Newline is deleted. If you write what looks like a trigraph with a Backslash-Newline inside, the Backslash-Newline is deleted as usual, but it is then too late to recognize the trigraph. <p>
This exception is relevant only if you use the `<samp>-trigraphs</samp>' option to enable trigraph processing. See <a href="Invocation.html">Invocation</a>. </ul>
