<h4>Unintended Grouping of Arithmetic</h4>
<p>
You may have noticed that in most of the macro definition examples shown above, each occurrence of a macro argument name had parentheses around it. In addition, another pair of parentheses usually surround the entire macro definition. Here is why it is best to write macros that way. <p>
Suppose you define a macro as follows, <p>
<pre>
	#define ceil_div(x, y) (x + y - 1) / y
</pre>
<p>
whose purpose is to divide, rounding up. (One use for this operation is to compute how many `<samp>int</samp>' objects are needed to hold a certain number of `<samp>char</samp>' objects.) Then suppose it is used as follows: <p>
<pre>
	a = ceil_div (b &amp; c, sizeof (int));
</pre>
<p>
This expands into <p>
<pre>
	a = (b &amp; c + sizeof (int) - 1) / sizeof (int);
</pre>
<p>
which does not do what is intended. The operator-precedence rules of C make it equivalent to this: <p>
<pre>
	a = (b &amp; (c + sizeof (int) - 1)) / sizeof (int);
</pre>
<p>
But what we want is this: <p>
<pre>
	a = ((b &amp; c) + sizeof (int) - 1)) / sizeof (int);
</pre>
<p>
Defining the macro as <p>
<pre>
	#define ceil_div(x, y) ((x) + (y) - 1) / (y)
</pre>
<p>
provides the desired result. <p>
However, unintended grouping can result in another way. Consider `<samp>sizeof ceil_div(1, 2)</samp>'. That has the appearance of a C expression that would compute the size of the type of `<samp>ceil_div (1, 2)</samp>', but in fact it means something very different. Here is what it expands to: <p>
<pre>
	sizeof ((1) + (2) - 1) / (2)
</pre>
<p>
This would take the size of an integer and divide it by two. The precedence rules have put the division outside the `<samp>sizeof</samp>' when it was intended to be inside. <p>
Parentheses around the entire macro definition can prevent such problems. Here, then, is the recommended way to define `<samp>ceil_div</samp>': <p>
<pre>
	#define ceil_div(x, y) (((x) + (y) - 1) / (y))
</pre>
<p>
