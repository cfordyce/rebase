<h3>Miscellaneous Preprocessing Directives</h3>
<p>
This section describes three additional preprocessing directives. They are not very useful, but are mentioned for completeness. <p>
The <i>null directive</i> consists of a `<samp>#</samp>' followed by a Newline, with only whitespace (including comments) in between. A null directive is understood as a preprocessing directive but has no effect on the preprocessor output. The primary significance of the existence of the null directive is that an input line consisting of just a `<samp>#</samp>' will produce no output, rather than a line of output containing just a `<samp>#</samp>'. Supposedly some old C programs contain such lines. <p>
The ANSI standard specifies that the `<samp>#pragma</samp>' directive has an arbitrary, implementation-defined effect. In the GNU C preprocessor, `<samp>#pragma</samp>' directives are not used, except for `<samp>#pragma once</samp>' (see <a href="Once-Only.html">Once-Only</a>). However, they are left in the preprocessor output, so they are available to the compilation pass. <p>
The `<samp>#ident</samp>' directive is supported for compatibility with certain other systems. It is followed by a line of text. On some systems, the text is copied into a special place in the object file; on most systems, the text is ignored and this directive has no effect. Typically `<samp>#ident</samp>' is only used in header files supplied with those systems where it is meaningful. <p>
