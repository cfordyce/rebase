<h3>C Preprocessor Output</h3>
<p>
The output from the C preprocessor looks much like the input, except that all preprocessing directive lines have been replaced with blank lines and all comments with spaces. Whitespace within a line is not altered; however, a space is inserted after the expansions of most macro calls. <p>
Source file name and line number information is conveyed by lines of the form <p>
<pre>
	# <i>linenum</i> <i>filename</i> <i>flags</i>
</pre>
<p>
which are inserted as needed into the middle of the input (but never within a string or character constant). Such a line means that the following line originated in file <i>filename</i> at line <i>linenum</i>. <p>
After the file name comes zero or more flags, which are `<samp>1</samp>', `<samp>2</samp>' or `<samp>3</samp>'. If there are multiple flags, spaces separate them. Here is what the flags mean: <p>
<dl>
<dt>
`<samp>1</samp>'<dd>
This indicates the start of a new file. <dt>
`<samp>2</samp>'<dd>
This indicates returning to a file (after having included another file). <dt>
`<samp>3</samp>'<dd>
This indicates that the following text comes from a system header file, so certain warnings should be suppressed. </dl>
