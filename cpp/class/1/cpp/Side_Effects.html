<h4>Duplication of Side Effects</h4>
<p>
Many C programs define a macro `<samp>min</samp>', for ``minimum'', like this: <p>
<pre>
	#define min(X, Y)  ((X) &lt; (Y) ? (X) : (Y))
</pre>
<p>
When you use this macro with an argument containing a side effect, as shown here, <p>
<pre>
	next = min (x + y, foo (z));
</pre>
<p>
it expands as follows: <p>
<pre>
	next = ((x + y) &lt; (foo (z)) ? (x + y) : (foo (z)));
</pre>
<p>
where `<samp>x + y</samp>' has been substituted for `<samp>X</samp>' and `<samp>foo (z)</samp>' for `<samp>Y</samp>'. <p>
The function `<samp>foo</samp>' is used only once in the statement as it appears in the program, but the expression `<samp>foo (z)</samp>' has been substituted twice into the macro expansion. As a result, `<samp>foo</samp>' might be called two times when the statement is executed. If it has side effects or if it takes a long time to compute, the results might not be what you intended. We say that `<samp>min</samp>' is an <i>unsafe</i> macro. <p>
The best solution to this problem is to define `<samp>min</samp>' in a way that computes the value of `<samp>foo (z)</samp>' only once. The C language offers no standard way to do this, but it can be done with GNU C extensions as follows: <p>
<pre>
	#define min(X, Y)                     \
	({ typeof (X) __x = (X), __y = (Y);   \
	   (__x &lt; __y) ? __x : __y; })
</pre>
<p>
If you do not wish to use GNU C extensions, the only solution is to be careful when <em>using</em> the macro `<samp>min</samp>'. For example, you can calculate the value of `<samp>foo (z)</samp>', save it in a variable, and use that variable in `<samp>min</samp>': <p>
<pre>
	#define min(X, Y)  ((X) &lt; (Y) ? (X) : (Y))
	...
	{
	  int tem = foo (z);
	  next = min (x + y, tem);
	}
</pre>
<p>
(where we assume that `<samp>foo</samp>' returns type `<samp>int</samp>'). <p>
