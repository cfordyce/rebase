<h4>Swallowing the Semicolon</h4>
<p>
Often it is desirable to define a macro that expands into a compound statement. Consider, for example, the following macro, that advances a pointer (the argument `<samp>p</samp>' says where to find it) across whitespace characters: <p>
<pre>
	#define SKIP_SPACES (p, limit)  \
	{ register char *lim = (limit); \
	  while (p != lim) {            \
	    if (*p++ != ' ') {          \
	      p--; break; }}}
</pre>
<p>
Here Backslash-Newline is used to split the macro definition, which must be a single line, so that it resembles the way such C code would be laid out if not part of a macro definition. <p>
A call to this macro might be `<samp>SKIP_SPACES (p, lim)</samp>'. Strictly speaking, the call expands to a compound statement, which is a complete statement with no need for a semicolon to end it. But it looks like a function call. So it minimizes confusion if you can use it like a function call, writing a semicolon afterward, as in `<samp>SKIP_SPACES (p, lim);</samp>' <p>
But this can cause trouble before `<samp>else</samp>' statements, because the semicolon is actually a null statement. Suppose you write <p>
<pre>
	if (*p != 0)
	  SKIP_SPACES (p, lim);
	else ...
</pre>
<p>
The presence of two statements---the compound statement and a null statement---in between the `<samp>if</samp>' condition and the `<samp>else</samp>' makes invalid C code. <p>
The definition of the macro `<samp>SKIP_SPACES</samp>' can be altered to solve this problem, using a `<samp>do ... while</samp>' statement. Here is how: <p>
<pre>
	#define SKIP_SPACES (p, limit)     \
	do { register char *lim = (limit); \
	     while (p != lim) {            \
	       if (*p++ != ' ') {          \
	         p--; break; }}}           \
	while (0)
</pre>
<p>
Now `<samp>SKIP_SPACES (p, lim);</samp>' expands into <p>
<pre>
	do {...} while (0);
</pre>
<p>
which is one statement. <p>
