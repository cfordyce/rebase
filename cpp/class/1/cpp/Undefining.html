<h3>Undefining Macros</h3>
<p>
To <i>undefine</i> a macro means to cancel its definition. This is done with the `<samp>#undef</samp>' directive. `<samp>#undef</samp>' is followed by the macro name to be undefined. <p>
Like definition, undefinition occurs at a specific point in the source file, and it applies starting from that point. The name ceases to be a macro name, and from that point on it is treated by the preprocessor as if it had never been a macro name. <p>
For example, <p>
<pre>
	#define FOO 4
	x = FOO;
	#undef FOO
	x = FOO;
</pre>
<p>
expands into <p>
<pre>
	x = 4;
	
	x = FOO;
</pre>
<p>
In this example, `<samp>FOO</samp>' had better be a variable or function as well as (temporarily) a macro, in order for the result of the expansion to be valid C code. <p>
The same form of `<samp>#undef</samp>' directive will cancel definitions with arguments or definitions that don't expect arguments. The `<samp>#undef</samp>' directive has no effect when used on a name not currently defined as a macro. <p>
