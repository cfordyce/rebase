INSTALLING

There's no automated configuration.  If you want to change the default
installation, you'll have to edit the Makefile by hand.

The default installation will give you:

/usr/lib/libcgi++.a		(CGI++ library)
/usr/include/CGI++		(CGI++ header files)
/usr/lib/libmini-g++.a		(mini-g++ library - see below)
/usr/include/mini-libg++	(mini-g++ header files - see below)

If you want to build it as a shared library, you're on your own.

A NOTE ABOUT LIBG++

GNU libg++ is no longer supported by the FSF.  With gcc versions up
to 2.7.x it works fine on all known Unix and Unix-like systems.
However, problems arise with later gcc/libg++ versions on some systems.

To avoid this, CGI++ now includes a bundled mini-g++ library, comprising
those parts of libg++ required by CGI++.  By default, CGI++ will install
and use this in place of libg++.  If you're sure your system has a sane
and working libg++ installed, you may prefer to remove the mini-g++
library from the Makefile, and use the real thing instead.  If in doubt,
use the mini-g++ provided, and make sure you link it explicitly in
programs using CGI++.
